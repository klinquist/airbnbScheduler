This is a nodejs script and accompanying web page that I use to control the mode and set the lock code using my Hubitat hub (home automation system) that is located in my Airbnb.

It parses the Airbnb iCal file to figure out what days people are checking in and out of the property, and sets modes at appropriate times.   

It also has the ability to configure manual visits, with our without lock coding.    Manual visits are used when I visit the property (and other visits that may not be part of the Airbnb calendar).
