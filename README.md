## Airbnb Lock Coder for Hubitat

This script is designed to program a lock code & set a mode on a Hubitat hub at Airbnb checkin/check out times.

This runs on a raspberry pi in my house on the same network as the Hubitat.


## Installation & Usage

* Git clone to a folder 
* Enter that folder and run `npm install`
* Edit the `config/default.json` to fit your needs.  Generate a pushover.net app & user token for push notifications.
* Run `node index.js`.  


There are three new optional keys that may not be obvious.  If you want to set an "arriving soon" mode, you can use these keys.  The first is the time the mode will be enabled, the second is the offset from the check-in day.

I use this to turn on my water heater.  I want to make sure guests have hot water when they arrive, so I need to turn it on prior to coding the lock and putting the home into "home" mode.  So I have an "arriving soon" mode that turns on the water heater at 1:00AM on the day of arrival.

If you want this to run a day *before* arrival, set arrivingSoonDayOffset to -1


```
    "arrivingSoonTime": "1:00 AM" //
    "arrivingSoonDayOffset": 0,
    "arriving_soon_mode":"ArrivingSoon", //what mode to enable
```



I recommend using a node process manager like _pm2_ to run it on startup.


## Differences between durability of this vs RBoy's Rental Lock Automator
Hopefully, most of us chose Hubitat because it doesn't require internet access!  RBoy's app could fail to program your lock if the internet is down at check-in time.  That said, RBoy's app has excellent retry mechanisms in place that I have not evaluated.  Currently, I program the lock, ask to refresh its status, then see if the code is present.  If not, I retry a few times.

I always recommend putting a backup code into the lock in one of its permanent slots.  That way, if a guest calls you and says their code is not working, you can always provide that backup code for their stay - then just change it afterwards.
